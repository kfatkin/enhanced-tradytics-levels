# enhanced-tradytics-levels
This repo is dedicated to an indicator developed for Tradingview that pulls Dealer, Darkpool, and standard S/R levels from Tradytics and adds them to Tradingview

To use this indicator, grab the latest copy of the script which can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfatkin/enhanced-tradytics-levels/main/levels_script.tps) and paste it in to TradingView's Pine Editor. Save this, and then add the indicator to your charts. For more detailed instructions, see the video by @kfatkin here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV-B5auLZMM - the process is basically the same, just with a different script.
